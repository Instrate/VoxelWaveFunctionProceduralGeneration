This is a C++ based project of my voxel engine implementation with some additional features

Libraries you need to work with this project:

-OpenGL

-GLFW

-GLM

-SOIL

-BoostC++

-freeglut

-GLEW

-Lua (I'm using dynamic x64-bit binaries)


The rendering logic is based on https://github.com/Instrate/BatymetriaEditor

Keep checking the progress. Updates come almost everyday
